Hi, I'm Henry, currently a graduate student of Computer Science at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp).
My main interests are formal methods, more specifically those applied to distributed systems and security protocols.

I've been programming since 2018, mainly using Java and Rust, but I also like functional programming languages. 

On this blog, I want to write about research papers that I find interesting or projects that I've done.
